remove stuff from _entityspice_entity_info if etype does not support it, e.g bundle and title

in docs say entities without title field should override buildContent of EntitySpiceEntity.
  -> or fix oven.

override title property key name and label.

 Add a page to see entity types info, their menu options and default entity type properties
 defined by ES:
function entityspice_admin_menu_output_alter(&$content)

say about devel

say about bad confusting names: type, bundle, entity, revision...

say why bundle fieldable -> as config;


disallow machine name: delete (etype_delete_form)
