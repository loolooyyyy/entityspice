remove stuff from _entityspice_entity_info if etype does not support it, e.g bundle and title

in docs say entities without title field should override buildContent of EntitySpiceEntity.
  -> or fix oven.

override title property key name and label.

 Add a page to see entity types info, their menu options and default entity type properties
 defined by ES:
function entityspice_admin_menu_output_alter(&$content)

say about devel

say about bad confusting names: type, bundle, entity, revision...

say why bundle fieldable -> as config;


disallow machine name: delete (etype_delete_form)


support of predelete and can delete optional, it doubles delete time because it loads entity twice.
entity cache is a good idea.


say how to do each shit. for instance how not to display custom fields: by 
overrighting controller class. look at controller classes.

t, filter_xss_admin and friends


say how safe works, say classes or tables may still collide




should beware of bundle permission? if so labels need check plain? where else does this need check plain?
how does the behaviour change if user decides to give permission?
where to checkplain always regardless of role, user and permissoin, just to be safe?

plugable access mechanism


remove these psudo fields from PLACEHOLDERS if entity does not actually have 'em:
  title field
  bundle name

  default views

  all places _es_get_entity

  on submit redirect?

  say you ave to implemetn is slef logic yourslef
